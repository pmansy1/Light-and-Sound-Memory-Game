2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

    One of the most difficult problems I faced while working on my entry was finding time in my hectic schedule. With my academic responsibilities, extracurricular commitments, and other personal projects, it wasn't easy to set aside time to focus on this task. While I was anxious to finish it, I realized that I needed to prioritize certain duties, such as my studies, leadership roles, and current projects.
    To tackle this challenge, I implemented a strategic approach to time management. Initially, I examined my weekly schedule to identify small windows of opportunity for improvement. Rather than waiting for lengthy, uninterrupted work sessions, I broke the assignment into smaller, more manageable tasks and tackled them whenever I had the chance. This approach enabled me to maintain productivity without feeling overwhelmed.
	Additionally, I set personal deadlines to keep myself accountable. Since I knew that my schedule was unpredictable, I aimed to complete sections of the submission ahead of time to avoid last-minute stress. I also used tools like calendar reminders and task lists to stay organized and ensure that I was making steady progress.
	Finally, this event demonstrated the value of balance and prioritizing. Although it was difficult to balance various commitments, I learnt how to work efficiently under time restrictions without losing quality. These challenges also reminded me that great time management is necessary for successfully navigating multiple responsibilities.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)

    After completing my submission, I found myself wanting to learn more about optimizing web applications while maintaining clean and efficient code. Web performance is critical, and I’m interested in best practices for structuring projects, minimizing load times, and ensuring smooth user interactions. Understanding how to balance performance with maintainability is something I’d like to explore further.
    Additionally, I’m curious about front-end frameworks and how developers decide when to use them. With so many options, React, Vue, Svelte, and others—it can be challenging to determine which framework is best suited for a particular project. I’d like to understand the decision-making process behind choosing a framework versus building with vanilla JavaScript, as well as the trade-offs involved.
    Another question that came to mind is how to effectively integrate third-party APIs and databases into a web application. While I have some experience working with Firebase and Supabase, I want to deepen my knowledge of best practices for authentication, data fetching, and security. Ensuring seamless communication between a web app and external services is an essential skill, and I’d love to learn more about how experienced developers approach these integrations.



4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would focus on two main areas, randomizing the pattern and improving the user interface.
First, I would work on randomizing the pattern each time the user starts a new game. Right now, the pattern is static, which means players can memorize it easily after a few rounds. By randomizing the pattern with each new game, I would make it more challenging and engaging for users. This would require modifying the game logic to ensure that the sequence of lights and sounds is generated in a random order every time.
Additionally, I would dedicate time to enhancing the user interface to make the game more visually appealing and user-friendly. While the current interface functions well, I believe a sleeker design with better color schemes, animations, and transitions could significantly improve the overall experience. I’d experiment with animations for light sequences, smooth transitions between different game states, and maybe add some sound effects.
